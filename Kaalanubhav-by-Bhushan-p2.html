                <p>
                    That night, Arjun was seated on his bed and fixed his watch. In the darkness, it remained steady inside him, shining with great intensity. He should not care. Did we only mention a timepiece? But it felt… different. 



                    Without any regard for the button, he accomplished it. 
                    
                    
                    
                    He was in a sea of gold that seemed to twist the air. He stumbled back, dizzy. The beginning gave the impression that time had already elapsed. The wheels started to spin as Arjun looked at his desk clock.. It read 6:50. PM. Shortly after 6.45. 
                    
                    
                    
                    He froze. The sight of Kisjör, the box that Arjun had spotted earlier, in the doorway was even more bizarre. Nevertheless, Kishor had not brought it back by 6:50 pm. PM. 
                    
                    
                    
                    Arjun's mind raced. He had stepped up just before.' He was shocked within a five-minute timeframe.
