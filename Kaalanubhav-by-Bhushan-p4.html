                <p>
                    After Kishor's disappearance, a spiral of spiraling events began. 



In the beginning, Arjun assumed he was doing nothing or performing a trick, but it turned out to be abnormal. What happened? At breakfast, Kishor was absent. His mobile device went straight to voicemail.. His bed was empty by the afternoon.. His things were gone. 



Arjun tried to ignore it. Maybe Kishor had gone somewhere. He went missing after several days.â€™ The. Arjun started to rethink his approach and investigate the circumstances surrounding the incident.' 



Kishor never returned, ever. Erased. Like he would never existed. 



Panic set in. Could the reason for this be his inclination to manipulate time? Did he forget his best friend? (Laughter)
