                    It was too much for Arjun to bear. He got out of his rut, looking for something like Kishor. In others, he wasn't. Did Arjun ever miss out on getting to know him? No way! 



                    He wasted no time and the damage was done as he continued to jump. Any minor changes had an impact on the real world. The timelines were fragmenting.

                    The words struck Arjun in the bud, hitting him hard. Kishor was gone. Completely. In accordance with this and all other timelines...
