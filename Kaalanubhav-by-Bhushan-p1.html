                    Arjun Naik was a non-believer in destiny. His approach to reasoning was based on both numbers and science and facts. In his view, life was predetermined and everything could be understood. The watch didn't seem to make sense, he said. 



Inside the university library, it was a rainy afternoon and everything seemed to be covered in white dust. Despite being interred in his quantum mechanics textbook, Arjun didn't seem coherent. The complexity of theories and equations was too great. Why? He couldn't help but stare at the library, where rows of old books were strewn with debris. 



At that juncture, he observed it. The sound was accompanied by a sudden glance, as if something was coming from the shelves. Up and watched with curiosity as he proceeded towards the rear of the room where I had been sitting. <br> <br>

A small, silver watch was positioned between two dusty books. No markings. Just a plain, simple thing. 



He picked it up. His fingers touching the metal resulted in strange events. An unexpected surge of light and motion engulfed him. The world flickered. 



“Arjun, you good?”. 



He blinked. He was accompanied by his best friend, Kishor, who had coffee with him. Arjun's heart was racing. It appeared to be a regular occurrence, but something had been altered. 



Arjun put the watch in his pocket with great force and proclaimed, "I am fine.". 

His plan was to eradicate it. Probably nothing. 



Kishor softly proclaimed, "You're welcome, my friend.". 
We will execute our plans for Mallett tomorrow. 



Right. The project. Arjun nodded, still uneasy. But Arjun left the library feeling that his life somehow has changed. Why?
