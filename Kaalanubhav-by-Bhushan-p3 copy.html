                    Arjun persisted in his experimentation for the next few days. The six-minute duration appeared to be a long time, but it was still manageable. Small adjustments like predicting quiz results, skipping mistakes, and bypassing awkward situations could be made by him. 



Soon, he grew bolder. In the past, he would attend lectures and then listen to questions from either the professor or other students. His life was a complete fabrication.' 



Yet it was more than just a school issue. He also started using the watch to achieve other objectives.' He would rapidly move past uncomfortable situations or intricate discussions.' 



A classmate named Akanksha observed him acting strangely on an evening. 



"Arjuna, do you feel comfortable with the expression? Apparently not," she inquired. 



He blinked, caught off guard. She was right. His mind had become consumed with reality, occupied with managing time. ". 



He declared he was fine, but in reality I knew she had the right answer. 

The changes were not good for him.'
